# ZEOS Token Contract

This is the smart contract for the [ZEOS](https://zeos.one) protocol for private and untraceable transactions on the EOS Blockchain. This contract is deployed to the [Kylin Testnet](https://kylin.bloks.io/account/thezeostoken) and the [EOS Mainnet](https://bloks.io/account/thezeostoken).

## Description
This contract issues the ZEOS tokens as well as all zAsset token types that will be added to the protocol in the future. This contract features the 'verifyproof' action which verfies zk-SNARKs. It currently supports the [Groth16](https://electriccoin.co/blog/bellman-zksnarks-in-rust/) proving system as well as [Halo2](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/index.html). The 'verifyproof' action depends on the [vCPU](https://liquidapps.io/vcpu) service of LiquidApps. Check out the [ZEOS Verifier](https://github.com/mschoenebeck/zeos-verifier) to learn more about the vCPU module this contract depends on.

This contract is built on [EOSIO](https://eos.io/) and [Liquidapps' DAPP Network](https://liquidapps.io/) services.
